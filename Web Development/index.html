    <h1>All about me</h1>
    <p>My name is Joseph Sarpong, I am enthusiastic about Mathematics. I love to talk about it and play around with it.</p>
    <p class="boldtext">Here's is a picture of me.</p>

    <p>My favorite quote currently is:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>
            Our successes are defined by the questions we ask, not the answers we have.
            </strong>
        </p>
    <cite>I don't remember who.</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Technology has changed the way we use maths lately and because I hate to feel useless, I am learning data science so that I do not feel useless.</p>

    <p>Banku is my favorite food. I am going to teach you how to serve it because I can't cook it.</p>

    <h2>How to serve banku</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash your hands</li>
        <li>Wash the bowl</li>
        <li>Take that banku out of the chest and take it out of the rubber</li>
        <li>Scoop the soup on the side because it tastes better on the side of the banku</li>
        <li>find someplace and eat your food in peace</li>
    </ol>
